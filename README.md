Covid-19 Data Exploration Project
Overview:
The Covid-19 Data Exploration project focuses on leveraging SQL queries to analyze and gain insights from datasets related to Covid-19 deaths and vaccinations. The primary goal is to extract meaningful information, calculate key metrics, and prepare the data for further analysis.

Project Components:
1. Data Selection and Initial Exploration:
The project starts by selecting relevant data from the CovidDeaths table, excluding records where the continent is null. The initial exploration involves ordering the results based on specific columns to provide a clear view of the dataset.

2. Initial Data View:
This step involves extracting specific columns from the CovidDeaths table, filtering out records with null continents, and ordering the results by location and date. The objective is to create an initial data view with a focus on relevant columns.

3. Death Percentage Calculation:
To understand the impact of Covid-19 in locations containing 'states,' the project calculates the death percentage based on total cases and total deaths. The query identifies potential areas with high mortality rates.

4. Population Infection Percentage:
This component involves calculating the percentage of the population infected with Covid-19 based on total cases and population. The results provide insights into the spread of the virus relative to the population size.

5. Highest Infection Rate:
The project identifies countries with the highest infection rates compared to their population. By grouping data and calculating percentages, the query helps pinpoint areas with significant infection challenges.

6. Highest Death Count:
This component focuses on finding countries with the highest death count per population. The query highlights areas where the impact of Covid-19 on mortality is particularly pronounced.

7. Continent-wise Death Count:
To offer a broader perspective, the project breaks down death counts by continent, showcasing continents with the highest death counts per population. This allows for a more global understanding of Covid-19's impact.

8. Global Covid-19 Summary:
This component provides a global summary by summing up new cases, total deaths, and calculating death percentages. The query offers an overview of the overall impact of Covid-19 on a global scale.

9. Population vs Vaccinations:
The project delves into the relationship between population and Covid-19 vaccinations. By calculating the percentage of the population that received at least one Covid vaccine, the query sheds light on vaccination progress.

10. Using CTE for Population vs Vaccinations:
A Common Table Expression (CTE) is employed to perform calculations related to population vs vaccinations. This demonstrates the use of advanced SQL techniques to enhance data analysis.

11. Using Temp Table for Population vs Vaccinations:
The project explores the use of a Temp Table to perform calculations on population vs vaccinations. Temp Tables provide a way to store intermediate results and simplify complex queries.

12. Creating a View for Population vs Vaccinations:
A view is created to store data for later visualizations. The view encapsulates the calculations related to population vs vaccinations, facilitating ease of access and reuse.

13. Querying the Created View:
The final component involves querying the created view to retrieve and analyze data. The view encapsulates valuable insights, and querying it allows for seamless exploration and visualization.

Conclusion:
The Covid-19 Data Exploration project is designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of Covid-19 datasets using SQL. By employing various queries and techniques, the project aims to uncover insights that can inform decision-making processes. The use of C
